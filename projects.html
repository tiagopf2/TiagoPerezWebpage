        <h2>Cybersecurity Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my personal projects in cybersecurity.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1: Raspberry Pi Attack</h3>
            <p>This project consists of programming a Raspberry Pi to act as an automated attack when plugged into a system. Instead of being recognized as a USB storage device, it was configured to emulate a keyboard, making it significantly more dangerous and fast. Using Python and Bash scripting, I programmed it to execute a predetermined script as soon as it was plugged in, without triggering security alerts.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Voronoi Diagram Applied to Soccer</h3>
            <p>This project explored the use of Voronoi diagrams to analyze spatial control in soccer. A Voronoi diagram divides the field into regions based on the closest player, visually representing which areas of the pitch are controlled by each team. This approach demonstrates how mathematics can be applied to sports, providing objective insights into team shape, pressing efficiency, and optimal movement patterns.</p>

            <h3>Project 3: Smart Brute Force Password Cracker</h3>
            <p>For this cybersecurity project, I created a smart brute-force password cracker that enhances traditional brute-force methods by incorporating social engineering techniques. The program generates a customized wordlist based on user inputs, applying variations like capitalization, leetspeak substitutions, and special character insertions to crack passwords more efficiently.</p>
