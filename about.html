            <h2>Hi, I'm Tiago Perez</h2>
            <p>I am a cybersecurity student originally from Spain, now studying in the United States. Ever since I moved here three years ago, I’ve been balancing my passion for cybersecurity with my love for sports and different jobs in order to pay my studies. As the captain of Anderson University's soccer team, I’ve learned the importance of discipline, strategy, and teamwork—skills that also play a huge role in my approach to cybersecurity. Whether I'm competing on the field or solving complex security challenges, I always push myself to improve, adapt, and stay ahead of the game.</p>

        <h3>My Cybersecurity Path</h3>
        <p>I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for solving complex challenges. My journey in cybersecurity started at Anderson University, and I’ve since gained hands-on experience in various aspects of the field, including penetration testing, network security, and incident response. All the classes and coursework I have taken in my Anderson University studies are available to see <a href="https://catalog.andersonuniversity.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=27&poid=2784&returnto=1566" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical expertise, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends and threats in the industry, and I usually engage in personal projects like the ones you can see <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I also value collaboration and teamwork, which is why I love participating in CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges and working on real-world projects with other passionate individuals. The most recent article regarding the Cybersecurity Competitions teams in Anderson University that I am part of can be found <a href="https://andersonuniversity.edu/news/anderson-university-lands-top-spot-national-cyber-league-competition/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Beyond Cybersecurity</h3>
        <p>Moving from Spain to the United States at 18 years old was one of the biggest challenges of my life, but also one of the most rewarding. Adapting to a new culture, language, and way of life pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me resilience. My mindset also changed—I started fighting for my future and doing whatever was in my hands to succeed. As a result, I will be graduating in December with a major that I truly enjoy. I am the captain of the soccer team and currently working at the university, gaining valuable experience in professional life.</p>
